# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
**Problem Decsription:**
This project is aimed at predicting the case of customers default payments in Taiwan. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. We can use the K-S chart to evaluate which customers will default on their credit card payments. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. This would inform the issuerâ€™s decisions on who to give a credit card to and what credit limit to provide. It would also help the issuer have a better understanding of their current and potential customers, which would inform their future strategy, including their planning of offering targeted credit products to their customers.
